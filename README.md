# What is Proxymon?
`Proxymon` is a Discord bot coded in Python 3 that is currently in development. This is an attempt at creating our own Pokémon or Pokémon-like game while still abiding by the usual conventions that the Pokémon games have to offer.

# What will be different compared to the usual Pokémon games?
We will be adding our very own [Fakemon](lmgtfy.com/?q=What+is+a+Fakemon%3F) and a completely separate fake *world* - PvP will be evident, but before then you can plan on seeing all of the Fakemon and experience your own journey.

# When will it be fully released?
The date is unknown for now because it is yet to be discussed; we will update this document when the decision has been made.
